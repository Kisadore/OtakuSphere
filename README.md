# OtakuSphere

Group 27: Adrian Miro, Kiahna Isadore, Dominic Maki, Maritza Buckner

Our team is developing a web application where anime fans can rate, review, and discuss anime with others. Our app will also have a social media aspect allowing users to follow others or add users as friends. Lastly, users will be able to create custom watchlists to track anime they plan to watch in the future and keep a record of what they have already watched. Our goal with OtakuSphere is to create a space for anime enjoyers to track all of the anime they have watched and plan on watching in the future, show some love for their favorite anime by creating ratings and reviews, and engage with a community of those with similar interests.
